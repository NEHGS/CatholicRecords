        In the summer of 1797, a young, devout French priest named Jean-Louis Lefebvre de Cheverus arrived in Boston on a mission, his cherished personal library of religious books in tow. [some of these are now at the Athenaem]. Cheverus had come at the urging of John Carroll, Bishop of the New England Church, who wanted to unite the the region's Catholics and reinvigorate their faith.
			</p>
      <div class="floated-box f-left">
        <img src="images/article-image3.jpg" alt="Article image"/>

      </div>
      <p>
        Carroll was only too happy to give Cheverus a mission:  minister to the people, unite the scattered faithful and help the church in Boston take root.
			</p>
      <p>
        Though only 28, Cheverus had already demonstrated deep conviction to his religion at great personal sacrifice. Amid the bloody turmoil of the French Revolution, he refused to pledge his loyalty to the government. This resistance cost him his parish and endangered his life, and he fled to London in disguise.
			</p>
      <p>
        While in England, Cheverus received a letter from his former professor Francis Matignon, now a Boston pastor, who vividly described the town's desperate need for Catholic benevolence.  If only you were here, lamented Matignon, you could do so much good work.
			</p>
      <p>
        Boston would present a new set of obstacles for Cheverus. Practicing Catholicism had only been legal in Massachusetts for 17 years, and many members of the majority-Protestant population were deeply suspicious of their "Popish" neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
        ​It would be another year before the construction of the first Holy Cross Church, later Cathedral, and another nine before The Archdiocese of Boston would establish itself there. The immigration boom which would see French-Canadians, Irish, Germans, Lithuanians, Italians and many other ethnic groups pour into New England was still nearly half a century away.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Matignon had informed Cheverus, priests were sorely needed to minister to their communities and perform the seven holy rites, called sacraments, that mark the passages of a Catholic's life, from baptism after birth to the annointing of the sick during illness or before death.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deeply literate and observant, Cheverus and his fellow priests were able to keep meticulous records of the sacraments they administered to Boston's Catholics, dating as far back at 1789, during the church's earliest presence in the rapidly developing region.
      </p>

        The Irish also had a small early presence in New England, long before the first major wave of Irish immigration, thanks to trans-Atlantic maritime trade. <span class="underline">During the 17th and 18th centuries, while there was little direct trade between Ireland and New England, ports in both places served as centers of trade and convenient stops for ships bound elsewhere. No major Irish settlements appeared in New England at this time, but Irish Catholic sailors found themselves scattered up and down the coast</span>. In addition, many Irish immigrated to America after the unsuccessful rebellion of 1798, when they fled Ireland out of fear of reprisal or punishment by the British government, including being transported as convicts to Australia

These early sacramental records include the first official Catholic baptisms in Boston, in this case presided over by the French priest Florent Bouchard de la Poterie, who will later be deposed for “unworthy conduct.”</p>

      <p class="text-bold t-center">By the end of the 18th century, Catholics of various ethnicities were spread widely around New England, but there were very few priests and no centralized church to lead them. At this time the only American archdiocese was in Baltimore—it encompassed the entire eastern seaboard, including the cities of New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. In response to this lack of leadership, the French Catholics decided to step back in. [choice of words might be too aggressive here?</p>
      <p>Father Francis Anthony Matignon was a refugee of France's own Revolution, but when he came to New England in 1792, he became an essential figure in Boston's Catholic community. His work in Boston was that of a missionary. He was sent there at the request of Baltimore's Bishop Carroll, in the hopes that his influence could help settle cultural differences between Boston's Catholics and create a unified congregation.</p>

      </div>
      <p>Joined by his friend [friend? colleague? fellow priest?] , Father John Cheverus, Matignon held religious services for the community in a former French Huguenot church on School Street. Then, in 1803, he oversaw the building of the first Holy Cross Church, which was funded in large part by donations from non-Catholic Bostonians, including U.S. President John Adams. By 1808, the Holy Cross Church was elevated to the rank of Cathedral, and the Diocese of Boston was born with Cheverus as its Bishop. The community was still relatively small at this time, but other churches began to pop up—including <span class="underline">St. Patrick Church in Maine</span>, which today is the oldest Catholic church in continuous use in New England.</p>
      <p>Matignon and Cheverus laid the stage for Boston's Catholics, but new waves of immigration to Boston in the 19th century would come to define the community as we know it today. Famine and poverty hit Ireland hard in the first half of the century, most notably during the Great Irish Famine of 1845-1852, pushing more than a million working-class Irish to seek better lives across the Atlantic. <span class="underline">By the 1850s, the Irish were Boston's largest ethnic group. [insert for IRISH databases on AA.org!!]</span> Catholics from other European countries followed during this time as well, most notably the Italians who established a community in Boston's North End.</p>

          <p>Late on the night of August 11th, 1834, an estimated fifty to a hundred men on a supposed rescue mission stormed the grounds of the Ursuline Convent in Charlestown, Massachusetts, now part of modern-day Somerville. The mob had been riled by rumors that a "mysterious woman" was being held captive by the nuns after one of the Sisters visited with a protestant family and expressed doubts that she later retracted. In the riots that ensued, the mob set fires, broke down doors and windows, and ransacked the building. The firemen called to the scene joined with spectators instead of intervening. The following night, on August 12th, a crowd returned and further destroyed the orchards, gardens, and fences.</p>
          <p>Anti-Catholic sentiments ran high in early New England, even after practice of the faith was made legal in the 1780's. Rumors that the Ursuline Convent, which housed a school for girls in addition to the nuns, were holding residents against their will were fueled by a convergence of prejudice and paranoia. Old pains from Reformation-era Europe carried over into colonial fears that the Pope would influence American politics. Most of the students at the school were from wealthy protestant families, and the laboring-class protestant rioters feared what they saw as a conspiracy between their economic and religious antagonists. Xenophobia was also a factor, as many Catholic immigrants to the United States came from different national and ethnic backgrounds than the Anglo-Saxon settlers.</p>
          <p>The city of Boston officially condemned the actions of the rioters at the Ursuline Convents, although those arrested were acquitted. Most of the nuns dispersed to Quebec. Without insurance or sufficient remittance to rebuild, the ruins sat unchanged for fifty years afterwards, in stark contrast to the nearby Bunker Hill Monument built in the 1840s. The land was eventually leveled and developed for housing, but a few stones from the ruins were repurposed for a vestibule archway in Boston's Cathedral of the Holy Cross.</p>

      <p class="text-bold t-center">As Boston's Catholic population grew, so did the prominence and power of the church—but prejudice still ran deep in the city.</p>
      <p>Over time, anti-Catholic sentiment evolved further away from its roots in the Protestant Reformation, and came to serve more and more as an excuse for xenophobia and classism.</p>
      <p>For example, during the worldwide cholera epidemic of the early 19th century, disease spread via contaminated water in densely populated areas; <span class="underline">in Boston, blame for sickness lay squarely on the shoulders of the Irish Catholic community</span>.</p>
      <p>Fights and riots broke out in the streets between immigrant groups and the English-descended elite—the historically Puritan society distrusted the pageantry of Catholic religious practice, especially when it came to the loud music and keening of Irish funeral processions.</p>
      <p>But as time went on and ethnic diversity increased, it became difficult to deny the Catholic Church's place in the fabric of Boston.</p>
      <blockquote>
        At First, Holy Cross was the only Paris in Boston. As immigration increased, However, the need for more and more churches to serve the city's catholic population grew.

​        Catholics also began to spread away from the city itself and settle into the surrounding suburbs. At first, Parises established outside of Boston might serve people from across several towns; As the population grew, more and more churches were established to accommodate those far from the city. The Diocese grew.</blockquote>
      <p>The first major factions in Boston happened along ethnic lines—sharply divided ethnic neighborhoods made this easy. By 1830, there was a sizable population of German Catholics in Boston. The Catholic Church in America at that time was perceived by many as being an Irish church, and the German immigrants wished to have priests who understood their religious customs and spoke their language</p>
      <p><span class="underline">In 1844, Holy Trinity Church was founded in the South End of Boston for the German Catholic community. Saint Leonard of Port Maurice Church in the North End was established in 1873 for Italian immigrants who had settled in the neighborhood, and in 1893, the Archdiocese founded Our Lady of Czestochowa Church in South Boston for the Polish-Catholic immigrant community</span>.</p>
      <p>Outside of the city, by the 1870s, the large population of French-Canadian immigrants, many of whom had come to Massachusetts to work in the mills, led to the establishment of churches like Saint Joseph (later Saint Jean Baptiste) in Lowell, Saint Anne in Lawrence, and Saint Joseph in Salem.</p>
      <p>Eventually, particularly in small suburban towns, where there was often just one church, geography trumped ethnicity, and a mix of ethnic groups could be found in many parishes. Even some urban parishes, such as St. Paul's Church in Harvard Square, Cambridge, reflected a more integrated diversity as compared to Boston. <span class="underline">In addition to the Irish Catholics, a community of African-Canadian Catholics descended from slaves in Halifax, Nova Scotia, immigrated to the area and attended St. Paul’s. There are even records that interracial marriages were performed within this parish through 1880</span>.</p>
      <p>The church came to play an essential role in Catholic life. For working class Irish and others, work often involved dispersal: men might work at factories or lumber yards which took them away from their homes more often than not, while women might work as servants in wealthy Protestant houses outside of their own communities. Because of this, church services on Sundays became the place for neighbors to come together, and for young people to find spouses. <span class="underline">The late 19th century saw an increase in young men's and women's programs at churches, designed to centralize social life within the Catholic community.</p>

          <p>Lowell, Massachusetts, and the surrounding cities and towns along the Merrimack River Valley in northern Massachusetts, played an important a role in the growth of the Catholic community.</p>
          <p>Considered the "cradle of the American Industrial Revolution," Lowell is named after the textile merchant who brought power looms to the area in the 1820's. The construction of dams to harness the river's energy and the proliferation of manufacturing in the area coincided with early waves of immigrant groups seeking work, mostly French Canadian, Irish, and German Catholics. The majority of the textile workforce in particular were women and young girls.</p>
          <p>As industry grew, the organization of society changed, too. Densely-populated ethnic neighborhoods replaced company-owned boarding houses, and churches became the hearts of their communities for politics and recreation as much as worship.</p>
          <p>The growth of the church is visible with the increase of parishes in the region during the decades when it was the industrial bedrock of the United States. Victories or setbacks in one area of life had implications in others.</p>
          <p>​Catholics, alongside other laboring immigrant and minority groups, struggled as much for freedom from discrimination as they did for fair pay, overtime, and educational opportunities. In this way, the effort for religious acceptance by a once-outlawed demographic was inextricably linked with the origins of a national movement towards organized labor.</p>

      <p class="text-bold t-center">In 1828, after Bishop Cheverus stepped down from his position, Bishop Benedict Joseph Fenwick became the first non-French leader of the Boston diocese.</p>
      <p>As a missionary and a cultural outsider, Cheverus had been focused on propagation and conversion; Fenwick instead focused on uniting the existing Catholic community and smoothing over relations with Boston as a whole.</p>
      <p>In 1829 he founded a Catholic newspaper which still exists today, now known as The Pilot. [link to The Pilot] He also published a number of pamphlets explaining the true nature of Catholicism to the public. In addition, Fenwick opened Boston College, which began its life as a series of lectures in the basement of his cathedral; later, he opened a Jesuit school in Worcester called the College of the Holy Cross.</p>
      <p>​He worked hard to deal with riots spurred by anti-Catholic sentiment, to create positive relationships between the Church and Boston's Protestant elite, and to promote Catholic education across Massachusetts—and the institutions he created still stand today.</p>
      <p>In 2010, the Religion Census reported that 45% of Massachusetts residents self-identify as Catholic—a massive presence for a religion whose practice was constitutionally illegal just three hundred years ago. Today, Boston is known as an iconic Catholic city.</p>
      <p>[Some of Chev's records are now at the Athenaem, the region is partially defined by the church architecture, etc etc. But most importantly we have all these records now here, so Call To Action.]</p>
      <p>By peering into the records of our past, from the very first parish on, we paint a picture of a quintessentially American city. We see a microcosm of diverse cultures, and we can trace the threads of these cultures across time. We can see how the threads knit together, and how they clash against each other. We can understand the complex social fabric we live within today.</p>
