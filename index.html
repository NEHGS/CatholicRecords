          In the summer of 1797, an earnest young French priest named Jean-Louis Lefebvre de Cheverus arrived in Boston, eager to help American Catholics any way he could. He wrote to John Carroll, Bishop of the New England Church, requesting to be sent where he "was most needed, without making yourself anxious about the means of my support. I am willing to work with my hands, if need be."
        </p>
        <div class="floated-box f-left">
          <img src="images/article-image3.jpg" alt="Jean-Louis Anne Madelain Lefebvre de Cheverus"/>
          <span class="image-caption-content t-center">Jean-Louis Anne Madelain Lefebvre de Cheverus, as Bishop Cheverus. Painting by Gilbert Stuart, 1823. Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.</span>
        </div>
        <p>
          Carroll was only too happy to give Cheverus a mission:  minister to the people, unite the scattered faithful and help the church in Boston take root.
        </p>
        <p>
          Though only 28, Cheverus had already demonstrated deep conviction to his religion at great personal sacrifice. Amid the bloody turmoil of the French Revolution, he refused to pledge his loyalty to the government. This resistance cost him his parish and endangered his life, and he fled to London in disguise.
        </p>
        <p>
          While in England, Cheverus received a letter from his former professor Francis Matignon, now a Boston pastor, who vividly described the town's desperate need for Catholic benevolence.  If only you were here, lamented Matignon, you could do so much good work.
        </p>
        <p>
          Boston would present a new set of obstacles for Cheverus. Practicing Catholicism had only been legal in Massachusetts for 17 years, and many members of the majority-Protestant population were deeply suspicious of their "Popish" neighbors.
        </p>
        <p>
          It would be another year before the construction of the first Holy Cross Church, later Cathedral, and another nine before The Archdiocese of Boston would establish itself there. The immigration boom which would see French-Canadians, Irish, Germans, Lithuanians, Italians and many other ethnic groups pour into New England was still nearly half a century away.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Matignon had informed Cheverus, priests were sorely needed to minister to their communities and perform the seven holy rites, called sacraments, that mark the passages of a Catholic's life, from baptism after birth to the annointing of the sick during illness or before death.
        </p>
        <p>
          Deeply literate and observant, Cheverus and his fellow priests were able to keep meticulous records of the sacraments they administered to Boston's Catholics, dating as far back at 1789, during the church's earliest presence in the rapidly developing region.
        </p>

          Today, these detailed documents are a critical resource for researchers, historians and genealogists, especially for moments when secular records are spotty or lost. They record important moments in the lives of the individuals, families, and communities who transformed the Catholic Church from a minor presence in the Protestant town to the defining religion of a major American city.
        </p>
        <p>
          The story of how Massachusetts's early Catholic Church flourished illustrates how America grew, as new groups arrived and clashed with earlier settlers, disparate communities found common ground, and ancient traditions were absorbed and transformed into new cultures.

          The Irish also had a small early presence in New England, long before the first major wave of Irish immigration, thanks to trans-Atlantic maritime trade. <span class="underline">During the 17th and 18th centuries, while there was little direct trade between Ireland and New England, ports in both places served as centers of trade and convenient stops for ships bound elsewhere. No major Irish settlements appeared in New England at this time, but Irish Catholic sailors found themselves scattered up and down the coast</span>. In addition, many Irish immigrated to America after the unsuccessful rebellion of 1798, when they fled Ireland out of fear of reprisal or punishment by the British government, including being transported as convicts to Australia

                            The Massachusetts constitution legalizes Catholicism in 1780. A parish of French and Irish Catholics begin worshipping in a small brick French Protestant meeting house located on the south side of School Street in Boston. Itâ€™s there that the first public mass is celebrated in 1788.
                            These early sacramental records include the first official Catholic baptisms in Boston, in this case presided over by the French priest Florent Bouchard de la Poterie, who will later be deposed for "unworthy conduct."

                            Catholics remain scattered across eastern Massachusetts. A report made to Bishop Carroll during this time states that there are only 210 Catholics in Boston,
                            15 in Plymouth, 21 in Newburyport, and 3 in Salem. An epidemic of yellow fever strikes Boston (along with New York City and Philadelphia) hard in the summer of 1798,
                            killing thousands. Fathers Cheverus and Matignon tirelessly care for the sick, earning praise and respect from Protestants and Catholics alike.
                            Planning for the construction of the Holy Cross Church begins in 1799.

                            Leading Protestant public figures and families, including John Adams, donate generously to the construction of Bostonâ€™s first Catholic Church,
                            which is planned by celebrated architect Charles Bulfinch, who designed Bostonâ€™s State House and Washington DCâ€™s capitol.
                            The Holy Cross Church is dedicated in September 29, 1803 by Bishop Carroll, who has traveled from Baltimore for the occasion.
                            Bishop Carrollâ€™s visit invigorates the local Catholic community and by 1805, the congregation has grown to 500.
                            Father Cheverus is appointed Bishop of Boston in 1808, and the Diocese of Boston is officially established.

                          <p>In the 1810s, the city of Boston grows alongside the rest of the young country as New World trading and manufacturing companies launch to great success. Nationally, this decade sees the creation of the stars and stripes insignia and the writing of "The Star Spangled Banner." Locally, the population of Boston booms to around 40,000, a workforce that would prove crucial for the infancy of the American Industrial Revolution along its waterways. Having committed the engineering details of English and Scottish power looms to memory in secret, a young Francis Cabot Lowell returns to Massachusetts in 1812 and founds The Boston Manufacturing Company. For a detailed look at the relationship between the textile industry and the growth of the Catholic Church, see our section on the Lowell Mills.

                            In 1822, Boston changes its status from town to city. Infrastructure improvement projects begin in earnest.
                            Roads and sewers are rebuilt, and the cityâ€™s docks are organized into a vital business hub around Faneuil Hall,
                            which is expanded in 1826 to include Quincy Market, designed in the highly popular Greek Revival architectural style.
                            More Catholic churches spring up in nearby towns, including Immaculate Conception (1826) in Salem, Saint Mary (1828) in Charlestown, and Saint Patrick (1831) in Lowell.

                            A steady number of Catholic immigrants settling in and around Boston results in new churches in Roxbury, Waltham and Quincy.
                            While Irish priests try their best to minister to all Catholics, newly arrived immigrants from other countries â€“ including Germany -- prefer
                            to practice their faith in their own language. Bishop Benedict Joseph Fenwick requests German priests and several arrive in Boston,
                            but all choose to move on to the Midwest where they can serve larger German Catholic parishes.

                          <p>Irelandâ€™s potato famine, which begins in 1845, drives tens of thousands of working-class Irish to Bostonâ€™s shores. During this decade, the cityâ€™s population balloons from 93,000 to 136,000, a trend that will continue into the next century. More Catholic churches are built to accommodate the new arrivals, expanding into Norfolk and Plymouth counties on the South Shore, starting with Quincyâ€™s St. Mary in 1840 and Bridgewaterâ€™s St. Thomas Aquinas in 1848.

In the 1860s, the original Holy Cross Cathedral is demolished to make way for its much larger successor in the South End. Additionally, Massachusetts plays a significant role in the American Civil War, as a long time center of abolitionist thought and activism. The choice by many Catholic immigrants to take up the Union cause had the lasting effect of softening anti-Catholic prejudice in the North.

                          <p>In 1871, after decades of conflict, the Kingdom of Italy consolidated the city-states along the Italian peninsula into a single nation. Facing new economic difficulties under the regime, and encouraged by the call for laborers in America following the death tolls of the Civil War, many Italians made their way to the United States. Despite regional differences, in Boston, Italian immigrants famously settled together in the North End neighborhood. Saint Leonard of Port Maurice, founded there in 1873 to serve this growing population, was the first Italian Catholic parish in the country as well as the city.

                          <p>While Portuguese Jews had come to New England since the 18th century to escape persecution, Portuguese Catholics from the mainland as well as the Azores and Cape Verde islands arrived to the regionâ€™s coastal cities in large number near the end of the 19th century. While some worked in the booming textile mills or other industries, many brought their skills in whaling and fishing. Our Lady of Good Voyage, founded in 1889 in the port town of Gloucester on the North Shore, was the areaâ€™s first Portuguese parish. Itâ€™s name evokes the significance that both work and faith played in the fraternity of Portuguese-American Catholics.

        <p class="text-bold t-center">It wasn't easy being Catholic in the Massachusetts Bay Colony.</p>
        <p>The Puritans came to reside in Boston, Salem, and the surrounding area by 1630, and they brought with them <span class="underline">strong anti-Catholic sentiment</span>. They objected to the perceived corruption and ostentatious pageantry of the Catholic Church back in Europe, and they especially distrusted any hint of allegiance to the Pope.</p>
        <p><span class="underline">In 1647, a law was passed banning any Catholic priests from practicing in the colony on pain of death</span>. While no priests were ever put to death under this law, prejudicial feelings were strong, especially towards lower class Irish Catholics in the community. <span class="underline">One Irish woman, Ann Glover, was hanged as a witch in Boston in 1688; records suggest that she was targeted because she could only speak Irish Gaelic and Latin, and would not renounce her Catholic faith</span>.</p>

        <p>The American Revolution marked a gradual shift in attitudes, spurred on by political necessity. As the colonies attempted to unite and overthrow British rule, support from France and French Canada became crucial, and open disdain for Catholicism among the people threatened to disrupt these alliances.</p>
        <p>At the time, however, anti-papist traditions were in full swing. <span class="underline">Boston celebrated an annual event known as Pope Night, an offshoot of England's Guy Fawkes Day, during which mobs swarmed the streets and a Pope effigy was burned on Boston Common</span>. In 1775, George Washington himself put a stop to these proceedings, feeling that such a display would insult those whose aid he was courting. The tradition carried on for two years after, but ultimately ended when France's aid in the Revolutionary War proved essential.</p>
        <p>After the war, while anti-Catholic prejudice was far from over, its vehemence tapered off. The Massachusetts constitution was amended to allow Catholics to practice their faith in 1780. With this, the door to truly establishing the Catholic Church in Massachusetts was openedâ€”it was only a matter of who and when.</p>

        <p class="text-bold t-center">By the end of the 18th century, Catholics of various ethnicities were spread widely around New England, but there were very few priests and no centralized church to lead them. At this time the only American archdiocese was in Baltimoreâ€”it encompassed the entire eastern seaboard, including the cities of New York, Philadelphia, and Boston. In response to this lack of leadership, the French Catholics decided to step back in. [choice of words might be too aggressive here?</p>
        <p>Father Francis Anthony Matignon was a refugee of France's own Revolution, but when he came to New England in 1792, he became an essential figure in Boston's Catholic community. His work in Boston was that of a missionary. He was sent there at the request of Baltimore's Bishop Carroll, in the hopes that his influence could help settle cultural differences between Boston's Catholics and create a unified congregation.</p>

          <span class="image-caption-content t-center">By the end of the 18th century, Catholics of various ethnicities were spread widely around New England, but there were very few priests and no centralized church to lead them.</span>
        </div>
        <p>Joined by his friend [friend? colleague? fellow priest?] , Father John Cheverus, Matignon held religious services for the community in a former French Huguenot church on School Street. Then, in 1803, he oversaw the building of the first Holy Cross Church, which was funded in large part by donations from non-Catholic Bostonians, including U.S. President John Adams. By 1808, the Holy Cross Church was elevated to the rank of Cathedral, and the Diocese of Boston was born with Cheverus as its Bishop. The community was still relatively small at this time, but other churches began to pop upâ€”including <span class="underline">St. Patrick Church in Maine</span>, which today is the oldest Catholic church in continuous use in New England.</p>
        <p>Matignon and Cheverus laid the stage for Boston's Catholics, but new waves of immigration to Boston in the 19th century would come to define the community as we know it today. Famine and poverty hit Ireland hard in the first half of the century, most notably during the Great Irish Famine of 1845-1852, pushing more than a million working-class Irish to seek better lives across the Atlantic. <span class="underline">By the 1850s, the Irish were Boston's largest ethnic group. [insert for IRISH databases on AA.org!!]</span> Catholics from other European countries followed during this time as well, most notably the Italians who established a community in Boston's North End.</p>
        <p>As Boston's Catholic population grew, so did the prominence and power of the churchâ€”but prejudice still ran deep in the city. Over time, anti-Catholic sentiment evolved further away from its roots in the Protestant Reformation, and came to serve more and more as an excuse for xenophobia and classism. For example, during the worldwide cholera epidemic of the early 19th century, disease spread via contaminated water in densely populated areas; <span class="underline">in Boston, blame for sickness lay squarely on the shoulders of the Irish Catholic community</span>. Fights and riots broke out in the streets between immigrant groups and the English-descended eliteâ€”the historically Puritan society distrusted the pageantry of Catholic religious practice, especially when it came to the loud music and keening of Irish funeral processions. But as time went on and ethnic diversity increased, it became difficult to deny the Catholic Church's place in the fabric of Boston.</p>

          <section class="article-content">
            <p>Late on the night of August 11th, 1834, an estimated fifty to a hundred men on a supposed rescue mission stormed the grounds of the Ursuline Convent in Charlestown, Massachusetts, now part of modern-day Somerville. The mob had been riled by rumors that a "mysterious woman" was being held captive by the nuns after one of the Sisters visited with a protestant family and expressed doubts that she later retracted. In the riots that ensued, the mob set fires, broke down doors and windows, and ransacked the building. The firemen called to the scene joined with spectators instead of intervening. The following night, on August 12th, a crowd returned and further destroyed the orchards, gardens, and fences.</p>
            <p>Anti-Catholic sentiments ran high in early New England, even after practice of the faith was made legal in the 1780's. Rumors that the Ursuline Convent, which housed a school for girls in addition to the nuns, were holding residents against their will were fueled by a convergence of prejudice and paranoia. Old pains from Reformation-era Europe carried over into colonial fears that the Pope would influence American politics. Most of the students at the school were from wealthy protestant families, and the laboring-class protestant rioters feared what they saw as a conspiracy between their economic and religious antagonists. Xenophobia was also a factor, as many Catholic immigrants to the United States came from different national and ethnic backgrounds than the Anglo-Saxon settlers.</p>
            <p>The city of Boston officially condemned the actions of the rioters at the Ursuline Convents, although those arrested were acquitted. Most of the nuns dispersed to Quebec. Without insurance or sufficient remittance to rebuild, the ruins sat unchanged for fifty years afterwards, in stark contrast to the nearby Bunker Hill Monument built in the 1840s. The land was eventually leveled and developed for housing, but a few stones from the ruins were repurposed for a vestibule archway in Boston's Cathedral of the Holy Cross.</p>

        <p>Over time, anti-Catholic sentiment evolved further away from its roots in the Protestant Reformation, and came to serve more and more as an excuse for xenophobia and classism.</p>

        <p>But as time went on and ethnic diversity increased, it became difficult to deny the Catholic Church's place in the fabric of Boston.</p>
        <blockquote>
          <p>At First, Holy Cross was the only Paris in Boston. As immigration increased, However, the need for more and more churches to serve the city's catholic population grew.</p>
          <p>Catholics also began to spread away from the city itself and settle into the surrounding suburbs. At first, Parises established outside of Boston might serve people from across several towns; As the population grew, more and more churches were established to accommodate those far from the city. The Diocese grew.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The first major factions in Boston happened along ethnic linesâ€”sharply divided ethnic neighborhoods made this easy. By 1830, there was a sizable population of German Catholics in Boston. The Catholic Church in America at that time was perceived by many as being an Irish church, and the German immigrants wished to have priests who understood their religious customs and spoke their language</p>
        <p><span class="underline">In 1844, Holy Trinity Church was founded in the South End of Boston for the German Catholic community. Saint Leonard of Port Maurice Church in the North End was established in 1873 for Italian immigrants who had settled in the neighborhood, and in 1893, the Archdiocese founded Our Lady of Czestochowa Church in South Boston for the Polish-Catholic immigrant community</span>.</p>
        <p>Outside of the city, by the 1870s, the large population of French-Canadian immigrants, many of whom had come to Massachusetts to work in the mills, led to the establishment of churches like Saint Joseph (later Saint Jean Baptiste) in Lowell, Saint Anne in Lawrence, and Saint Joseph in Salem.</p>
        <p>Eventually, particularly in small suburban towns, where there was often just one church, geography trumped ethnicity, and a mix of ethnic groups could be found in many parishes. Even some urban parishes, such as St. Paul's Church in Harvard Square, Cambridge, reflected a more integrated diversity as compared to Boston. <span class="underline">In addition to the Irish Catholics, a community of African-Canadian Catholics descended from slaves in Halifax, Nova Scotia, immigrated to the area and attended St. Paulâ€™s. There are even records that interracial marriages were performed within this parish through 1880</span>.</p>
        <p>The church came to play an essential role in Catholic life. For working class Irish and others, work often involved dispersal: men might work at factories or lumber yards which took them away from their homes more often than not, while women might work as servants in wealthy Protestant houses outside of their own communities. Because of this, church services on Sundays became the place for neighbors to come together, and for young people to find spouses. <span class="underline">The late 19th century saw an increase in young men's and women's programs at churches, designed to centralize social life within the Catholic community.</p>

The construction of dams to harness the river's energy and the proliferation of manufacturing in the area coincided with early waves of immigrant groups seeking work, mostly French Canadian, Irish, and German Catholics. The majority of the textile workforce in particular were women and young girls.</p>
            <p>As industry grew, the organization of society changed, too. Densely-populated ethnic neighborhoods replaced company-owned boarding houses, and churches became the hearts of their communities for politics and recreation as much as worship.</p>
            <p>The growth of the church is visible with the increase of parishes in the region during the decades when it was the industrial bedrock of the United States. Victories or setbacks in one area of life had implications in others.</p>
            <p>â€‹Catholics, alongside other laboring immigrant and minority groups, struggled as much for freedom from discrimination as they did for fair pay, overtime, and educational opportunities. In this way, the effort for religious acceptance by a once-outlawed demographic was inextricably linked with the origins of a national movement towards organized labor.</p>

        <p class="text-bold t-center">In 1828, after Bishop Cheverus stepped down from his position, Bishop Benedict Joseph Fenwick became the first non-French leader of the Boston diocese.</p>
        <p>As a missionary and a cultural outsider, Cheverus had been focused on propagation and conversion; Fenwick instead focused on uniting the existing Catholic community and smoothing over relations with Boston as a whole.</p>
        <p>In 1829 he founded a Catholic newspaper which still exists today, now known as The Pilot. [link to The Pilot] He also published a number of pamphlets explaining the true nature of Catholicism to the public. In addition, Fenwick opened Boston College, which began its life as a series of lectures in the basement of his cathedral; later, he opened a Jesuit school in Worcester called the College of the Holy Cross.</p>
        <p>â€‹He worked hard to deal with riots spurred by anti-Catholic sentiment, to create positive relationships between the Church and Boston's Protestant elite, and to promote Catholic education across Massachusettsâ€”and the institutions he created still stand today.</p>
        <p>In 2010, the Religion Census reported that 45% of Massachusetts residents self-identify as Catholicâ€”a massive presence for a religion whose practice was constitutionally illegal just three hundred years ago. Today, Boston is known as an iconic Catholic city.</p>
        <p>[Some of Chev's records are now at the Athenaem, the region is partially defined by the church architecture, etc etc. But most importantly we have all these records now here, so Call To Action.]</p>
        <p>By peering into the records of our past, from the very first parish on, we paint a picture of a quintessentially American city. We see a microcosm of diverse cultures, and we can trace the threads of these cultures across time. We can see how the threads knit together, and how they clash against each other. We can understand the complex social fabric we live within today.</p>
